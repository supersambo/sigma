*This repository forks ```jjallaire/sigma``` and adds backwardreporting of javascript events  ```overNode``` and ```clickNode``` to r-server when using shiny apps. I updated the example below and the example in ```inst/examples/edisapora-shiny.R``` to reflect this functionality.*

### sigma


An R package with an interface to the [sigma.js](http://sigmajs.org) graph visualization library.

This package is intended as a simple demonstration of building R bindings to JavaScript libraries using the [htmlwidgets](https://github.com/ramnathv/htmlwidgets) framework. 

#### Installation

You can install the **sigma** package from GitHub as follows:

```r
devtools::install_github("supersambo/sigma")
```

#### Usage

The `sigma` function takes a [GEXF](http://gexf.net/format/) (Graph Exchange XML Format) file and produces an interactive visualization. For example:

```r
library(sigma)
sigma(system.file("examples/ediaspora.gexf.xml", package = "sigma"))
```

You can also use the **sigma** function within [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) documents and even within [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com) applications. For example:

```r
library(shiny)
library(sigma)

gexf <- system.file("examples/ediaspora.gexf.xml", package = "sigma")

ui = shinyUI(fluidPage(
sidebarPanel(
checkboxInput("drawEdges", "Draw Edges", value = TRUE),
checkboxInput("drawNodes", "Draw Nodes", value = TRUE),

textOutput("clickNode"),
textOutput("overNode")
),
mainPanel(
sigmaOutput('sigma')
)
))

server = function(input, output) {

output$clickNode <- renderText({ 
paste("clickNode:",input$clickNode)
})

output$overNode <- renderText({ 
paste("overNode:",input$overNode)
})


output$sigma <- renderSigma(
sigma(gexf, 
drawEdges = input$drawEdges, 
drawNodes = input$drawNodes)
)
}

shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```
